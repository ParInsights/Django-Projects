# Django-Projects
Django Projects #1 - Learning to Integrate Django framework onto python projects. 

This project required creating a quick web application that was powered by a SQL database (used sqllite) to help a pet adoption agency better maintain and track pet records related to vaccinations and pet information. 

The web application is in development - but we have created the admin page. Currently editing adn creating the templates.
